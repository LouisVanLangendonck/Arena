PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This small project is made only for fun. 
The purpose is to make a small duel game with Pygame in which two players on the same keyboard fight each other. 
Typically the characters are the people that play the game and arena background is inspired by settings known to the devs

SOFTWARE USE:
Python 3.8.11
pygame 2.0.1  

IF YOU WANT TO MAKE YOU OWN CHARACTER:
1) Draw your character + different animation frames in a 64 x 44 pixel grid
2) Upscale that 2X to put in eventual game
